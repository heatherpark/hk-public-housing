      Public housing in Hong Kong is a set of mass housing programmes
      through which the Government of Hong Kong provides affordable housing for
      lower-income residents. It is a major component of housing in Hong Kong,
      with nearly half of the population now residing in some form of public housing.
      The public housing policy dates to 1954, after a fire in Shek Kip Mei destroyed
      thousands of shanty homes end of 1953 and prompted the government to begin
      constructing homes for the poor.
